                    <h5><p>A drastic increase can be seen in food waste. As per data given by Food and Agriculture Organization (http://www.fao.org/food-loss-and-food-waste/flw-data), 1/3rd of food produced for human consumption is wasted globally, which accounts for almost 1.3 billion tons per year. On the other hand, also as per WHO20% of the population face extreme food shortages. Hence there is a need to come up with a solution that can avoid food waste & can help feed the needy.</p>

                    <p>This web-based Food Waste Management system can assist in collecting the leftover food from hotels & restaurants to distribute among those in need. Admin that are helping poor communities to battle against starvation &malnutrition can raise a request for food supply from restaurants through this application. Once the request is accepted, the Admin can collect the food from the restaurants   for   its   distribution.   In   this   way   this   android-based   food   waste management system will help restaurants to reduce food waste and will help in feeding the poor and needy people</p>

                    <p>In this system, we have tried to reduce restaurant food wastage by giving waste food to the needy people. The contacted person will raise a request, in case of any leftover food restaurants have. This request is sent to the donor who want to give leftover foods. Donor then approves the request and assigns it to the Admin for take away and forwards the request to the restaurant. The leftover food at the restaurant can be given to the needy people at the end of the day .The admin can track the history of restaurants and Donors for the leftover foods.</p></h5>
